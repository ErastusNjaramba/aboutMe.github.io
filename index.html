 I'm an individual who's passionate, about education in the field of technology.

 Throughout my journey, I have focused on fostering a love for learning and empowering students to excel in today's era. In my positions, I have successfully implemented teaching methods that seamlessly incorporate technology into the learning process. The goal is to create a dynamic classroom environment where students can freely explore, experiment and develop their thinking abilities.
 
 I also possess leadership experience as a Trainer at Tunapanda Institute. During this time I showcased communication, collaboration and decision-making skills. I am excited about the opportunity to lead a team of educators at TechLit and contribute towards advancing technology literacy in education.
 
 Apart from work, I am always eager to stay up to date with the advancements in both education and technology. I strongly believe that education and technology have the power to shape a future, which is why I am thrilled, at the prospect of joining the TechLit team.
 
 Thank you for considering my application.
